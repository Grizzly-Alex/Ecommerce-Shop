# Ecommerce Shop (client-server application based on microservice architecture)

### Description
Developing a project using the .NET 8 and ASP.NET Core framework. The application has a microservice architecture.
Why did I choose microservices for my project? Firstly, for educational purposes, and secondly, such architecture will allow me to easily expand the functionality of the application.
For each microservice will have its own architecture and its own database type. The services will use databases such as relational databases (PostgreSQL, Sql Server) and NoSQL(Redis, DocumentDb).
Implementing interaction between services via RabbitMQ message broker and using the Yarp API Gateway.
